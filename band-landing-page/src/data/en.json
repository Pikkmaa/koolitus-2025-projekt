Come autumn, they were joined by Madis (guitar).One dark autumn evening, after finishing the first draft of Smooth (song), they felt that the song deserved a bigger audience, resulting in the idea of forming a band. From 2021 spring to 2022 autumn the band was a brief home for various musicians while retaining the original trio. At the end of 2022, they were joined by Anna Siitan, with whom the band started using the name Night Flies."
